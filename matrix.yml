# This is a mapping of dockerfile -> "pre" scripts
# Note that the matrix can grow rapidly and we are limited to 256 matrix entries
# in github actions.
#
# Note any 'env:' entries must also be added to `docker run` in build-matrix.py
#
# `exclude` can be "ansible", "ansible-base", "rc", "beta", or any combination
# thereof.
#
# `build-args` will add a new matrix entry, passing the given build args to
# `docker build`. When this is specified, the pre is skipped in the default
# case (and ONLY run with the build args specified).
